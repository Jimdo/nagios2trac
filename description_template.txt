=== Incident ===
  * Does it affect only one user/colleague? Not an incident, normal support case.
  * What has been noticed? (e.g. nagios check + host that failed)
:comment_template
  * Who is affected? (all users, limited set of users, departments, partners, ...)
  * When did it start? (e.g. nagios reported time)
  * How did you notice it (Monitoring, Support..?)

=== Spread the word first, then act ===
  * Always put a link to this ticket everywhere you inform your colleagues about it
  * Tell Yammer group "System Status" when the incident started (latest 30min after incident notice!)
  * Update Yammer at least every hour for incidents during office hours, even if nothing changed.
  * Be available in Infrastruktur channel and communicate to your colleagues
  * Announce waiting times longer than one hour (e.g. waiting for the hosting provider) as "time for next update"

  * Update Ticket and Yammer AFTER incident is over, too.

=== Recommended Checks and Actions ===
  * [wiki:NuetzlicheShell], [wiki:AdminHandbuch]

=== Ask for Help (esp. during office hours) ===
  * Get help at big incidents and pair the incident
  * Ask for help in communication/documentation for bigger incidents

=== Post Mortem Analysis ===
  * How has it been resolved? What was the fix?
  * How was the issue triggered? What have been the circumstances?
  * What was affected? (see Incident, Who is already documented there)
  * How can this situation be avoided in the future? (only relevant if "rule of three" triggered or effect is considered "major" by the team)
  * Did a known standard solution work? If not: Document it! e.g. in [wiki:NuetzlicheShell], [wiki:AdminHandbuch]
  * Close the ticket, if no further actions can be derived from it.
